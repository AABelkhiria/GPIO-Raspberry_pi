# GPIO Raspberry_pi

General Purpose Input / Output (GPIO) ports are input / output ports widely used in the world of microcontrollers, particularly in the field of embedded electronics.

A GPIO connector provides an electronic card the ability to communicate with other electronic circuits.

* Linux natively recognizes GPIO ports.

A GPIO connector can be configured to act as an input (receiving a signal) or an output (transmitting a signal).
When configured as an output, you can write to an internal register to change the state of an output.
When configured as an input, its state can be detected by reading the contents of an internal register.
